# Annotations

Annotations provide metadata about the program elements in Java code. They can be applied to classes, methods, fields, parameters, and other program elements to convey additional information to the compiler or runtime environment. Annotations are prefixed with the `@` symbol.

## Built-in Annotations

Java provides several built-in annotations, some of which include:

-   `@Override`: Indicates that a method overrides a superclass method.
-   `@Deprecated`: Marks a program element as deprecated, meaning it should no longer be used.
-   `@SuppressWarnings`: Suppresses compiler warnings for specific types of warnings.
-   `@FunctionalInterface`: Indicates that an interface is a functional interface, meaning it has a single abstract method (SAM).

## Custom Annotations

You can also create your own custom annotations in Java by using the `@interface` keyword. Custom annotations can be used to define markers, markers with values, or single-element annotations.

```java
import java.lang.annotation.*;

@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
@Target(ElementType.METHOD)
public @interface MyAnnotation {
    String value() default "default value";
    int count() default 0;
}
```
