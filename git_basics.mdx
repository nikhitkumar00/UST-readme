# Git Basics

## Initialization (`git init`)

When starting a new project, you can initialize a Git repository in your project directory using the `git init` command. This command creates a new Git repository, which enables version control for your project.

```bash
git init
```

## Cloning Repositories (`git clone`)

To copy an existing Git repository from a remote source, you can use the `git clone` command followed by the URL of the repository.

```bash
git clone <repository_URL>
```

Cloning a repository creates a copy of the remote repository on your local machine, allowing you to work on the codebase and contribute changes.

## Tracking Files

After initializing a Git repository or cloning an existing one, Git will automatically start tracking changes to files in the repository. You can see the status of tracked files using `git status`.

```bash
git status
```

The `git status` command displays information about modified, staged, and untracked files in the repository.

## Editing Files

You can edit files in your project directory using any text editor or IDE. Git will track these changes once you've added them to the staging area.

```plaintext
# Edit a file
nano README.md
```

After making changes to a file, you can add it to the staging area using `git add`.

## Recursive Add

To add all modified and untracked files in your project directory to the staging area, you can use the `git add` command with the `-A` flag.

```bash
git add -A
```

This command recursively adds all changes, including new files, modified files, and deleted files, to the staging area.

## Backing Out Changes

If you want to discard changes made to a file since the last commit, you can use the `git checkout` command followed by the name of the file.

```bash
git checkout <filename>
```

This command reverts the specified file to its state at the last commit.

## Renaming Files

To rename a file in your Git repository, you can use the `git mv` command followed by the current filename and the new filename.

```bash
git mv <old_filename> <new_filename>
```

For example, to rename `file.txt` to `newfile.txt`, you would use:

```bash
git mv file.txt newfile.txt
```

## Moving Files

Similar to renaming files, you can move files to a different directory within your Git repository using the `git mv` command.

```bash
git mv <filename> <new_directory>
```

For example, to move `file.txt` to a directory named `docs`, you would use:

```bash
git mv file.txt docs/
```

## Deleting Files

To delete a file from your Git repository, you can use the `git rm` command followed by the filename. This will also remove the file from the working directory.

```bash
git rm <filename>
```

For example, to delete `file.txt`, you would use:

```bash
git rm file.txt
```

## Ignoring Unwanted Files and Folders

You can create a `.gitignore` file in your project directory to specify patterns of files and directories that Git should ignore. This is useful for excluding build artifacts, temporary files, and other unwanted files from being tracked by Git.

Example `.gitignore` file:

```bash
# Ignore compiled binaries
*.exe
*.o

# Ignore build directories
/build/
```

The patterns specified in the `.gitignore` file are applied recursively to all subdirectories of the repository.

# Branching and Merging

## Branches

Branches in Git are essentially pointers to a specific commit. They allow you to work on different features or fixes independently from the main codebase. By default, when you create a Git repository, you have one branch called `master` which typically represents the main, stable codebase.

## Feature Branches

Feature branches are branches created from the main codebase (`master` branch) to work on specific features or fixes. They allow developers to work on different features simultaneously without affecting the main codebase.

```bash
# Create a new feature branch
git checkout -b feature/new-feature
```

## Pulling Changes and Merging Branches

Pulling changes involves fetching the latest changes from a remote repository and merging them into your local repository.

### Pull Command

The `git pull` command is used to fetch changes from a remote repository and merge them into the current branch.

```bash
git pull origin master
```

This command fetches changes from the `master` branch of the remote repository named `origin` and merges them into the current branch.

## Merge Conflicts

Merge conflicts occur when Git is unable to automatically merge changes from different branches. This often happens when two branches have made conflicting changes to the same part of a file.

## Solving Merge Conflicts

To resolve merge conflicts, you need to manually edit the conflicted files to resolve the differences. After resolving conflicts, you need to add the changes and commit them to complete the merge.

```bash
# After resolving conflicts, add the conflicted files
git add <conflicted_files>

# Commit the merge
git commit -m "Merge branch 'branch_name'"
```

## Deleting Merged and Unmerged Branches

### Deleting Merged Branches

To delete a branch that has been merged into the main codebase, you can use the `git branch -d` command.

```bash
git branch -d branch_name
```

### Deleting Unmerged Branches

If you want to delete a branch that contains work that hasn't been merged yet, you can use the `-D` flag with the `git branch` command.

```bash
git branch -D branch_name
```

## Pushing Changes

After making changes to your local repository and merging branches, you may want to push these changes to a remote repository.

```bash
git push origin <branch_name>
```

This command pushes the changes from the specified branch to the remote repository named `origin`.

# Rebasing

Rebasing is another method for integrating changes from one branch into another. It involves moving the starting point of a branch to a new base commit. This can be useful for maintaining a linear project history.

## Rebasing

Rebasing is the process of moving or combining a sequence of commits to a new base commit. It essentially rewrites the commit history of a branch.

```bash
git rebase <base_branch>
```

This command applies all commits in the current branch that are not in `<base_branch>` on top of `<base_branch>`, effectively moving the current branch's starting point.

## Rebasing Merge Conflicts

Similar to merging, rebasing can also result in conflicts if changes from the current branch conflict with changes from the base branch.

To resolve rebasing conflicts, you follow a similar process to resolving merge conflicts. You manually edit the conflicted files, add the changes, and continue the rebase.

```bash
# After resolving conflicts, continue the rebase
git rebase --continue
```

## Difference Between Merge and Rebase

### Merge

-   Preserves the commit history of both branches.
-   Creates a merge commit to integrate changes from the source branch into the target branch.
-   Results in a non-linear project history.

### Rebase

-   Rewrites the commit history of the current branch.
-   Moves the current branch's commits to a new base commit.
-   Results in a linear project history.
-   Can lead to a cleaner and more readable commit history.

The choice between merge and rebase depends on the project's workflow and preferences. While merge preserves the history of individual branches, rebase creates a cleaner and more linear history but can lead to more complex conflicts.

# Diff

The `git diff` command is used to show the differences between two commits, branches, or files in a Git repository.

```bash
git diff <commit1> <commit2>
```

This command displays the differences between `<commit1>` and `<commit2>`.

# Stash

The `git stash` command is used to temporarily store changes that are not ready to be committed. This allows you to switch to a different branch or work on a different task without committing incomplete changes.

```bash
git stash
```

This command stashes the changes in the working directory.

# Restore

The `git restore` command is used to restore files or directories to their state at a specific commit or to discard changes in the working directory.

```bash
git restore <file>
```

This command restores the specified file to its state at the last commit.

# Commits

Commits in Git are snapshots of the repository at a specific point in time. Each commit records changes to files and includes a unique identifier called a commit hash.

```bash
git commit -m "Commit message"
```

This command creates a new commit with the changes staged in the index and attaches a commit message to describe the changes.

# Checkout

The `git checkout` command is used to switch between branches or to restore files to a previous state.

```bash
git checkout <branch_name>
```

This command switches to the specified branch.

# HEAD

In Git, `HEAD` is a reference to the currently checked out commit. It is a pointer that points to the tip of the currently checked out branch.

```bash
git checkout HEAD~1
```

This command checks out the commit before the current `HEAD`.

# Tagging

Tags in Git are references to specific commits, often used to mark release points or significant milestones in a project.

```bash
git tag v1.0
```

This command creates a lightweight tag named `v1.0` at the current `HEAD`.

# Releases

Releases in Git are specific versions of a project that are made available to users. They often coincide with tagged commits.

```bash
git tag -a v1.0 -m "Version 1.0 release"
```

This command creates an annotated tag named `v1.0` with a message describing the release.

# Squash

Squashing commits in Git is the process of combining multiple commits into a single commit.

```bash
git rebase -i HEAD~3
```

This command opens an interactive rebase session where you can squash commits.

# Revert

The `git revert` command is used to undo a previous commit by creating a new commit that undoes the changes introduced by the original commit.

```bash
git revert <commit>
```

This command creates a new commit that undoes the changes introduced by the specified commit.

# Reset

The `git reset` command is used to reset the current branch to a specific commit, discarding changes since that commit.

```bash
git reset --hard <commit>
```

This command resets the current branch to the specified commit and discards all changes.

# Workflows

Git workflows are methodologies for managing collaborative development using Git. Common workflows include centralized, feature branch, and forking workflows.

# Git and GitHub Workflows

Git and GitHub workflows refer to specific ways of using Git and GitHub to manage and collaborate on projects. This may include pull request-based development, continuous integration, and release management.

# Git Alias

Git aliases are shortcuts for Git commands or sequences of commands. They can be used to simplify frequently used Git commands or to create custom commands.

```bash
git config --global alias.co checkout
```

This command creates a global alias `co` for the `checkout` command.

# History

The history of a Git repository refers to the sequence of commits and changes made to the repository over time. Viewing the history allows you to track changes and understand the evolution of the project.

```bash
git log
```

This command displays the commit history of the current branch.

# Cleanup and Back to Origin (GitHub)

Cleaning up and returning to the origin in GitHub typically involves pushing local changes to a remote repository and resetting the local branch to match the remote branch.

```bash
git push origin <branch_name>
git reset --hard origin/<branch_name>
```

These commands push local changes to the remote repository and reset the local branch to match the remote branch, discarding any local changes.
