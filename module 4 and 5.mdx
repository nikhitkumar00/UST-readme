# Java

## Creating Objects, Class, and Instance Variables

In Java, an object is an instance of a class. To create an object, you use the `new` keyword followed by the class name and parentheses. Here's an example:

```java
// Creating an object of class MyClass
MyClass obj = new MyClass();
```

A class is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines the properties and behaviors that objects of the class will have.

Instance variables are variables declared within a class but outside any method. Each object of the class has its own copy of instance variables.

```java
public class MyClass {
    // Instance variables
    int x;
    String str;
}
```

## Working with Constructors

Constructors are special methods used for initializing objects. They have the same name as the class and are invoked automatically when an object is created. Constructors can initialize instance variables and perform any setup required.

```java
public class MyClass {
    int x;

    // Constructor
    public MyClass(int value) {
        x = value;
    }
}
```

## Types of Constructors

1. **Default Constructor**: Has no parameters.
2. **Parameterized Constructor**: Accepts parameters to initialize instance variables.
3. **Copy Constructor**: Constructs a new object by copying the values of an existing object.

```java
public class MyClass {
    int x;

    // Default Constructor
    public MyClass() {
        x = 0;
    }

    // Parameterized Constructor
    public MyClass(int value) {
        x = value;
    }

    // Copy Constructor
    public MyClass(MyClass obj) {
        x = obj.x;
    }
}
```

## Introduction and Types of Inheritance

Inheritance is a mechanism in Java where a new class inherits properties and behaviors from an existing class. It promotes code reusability and establishes a relationship between classes.

### Single and Multilevel Inheritance

-   **Single Inheritance**: When a class inherits from only one superclass.
-   **Multilevel Inheritance**: When a class inherits from a superclass, and that superclass itself inherits from another superclass.

```java
// Single Inheritance
class A {
    // superclass
}

class B extends A {
    // subclass
}

// Multilevel Inheritance
class A {
    // superclass
}

class B extends A {
    // subclass
}

class C extends B {
    // subclass of B, and indirectly of A
}
```

### Hierarchical Inheritance

Hierarchical inheritance is when multiple classes inherit from the same superclass.

```java
class A {
    // superclass
}

class B extends A {
    // subclass
}

class C extends A {
    // another subclass
}
```

## Polymorphism

Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It enables flexibility in method invocation.

### Method Overloading and Method Overriding

-   **Method Overloading**: When multiple methods in the same class have the same name but different parameters.
-   **Method Overriding**: When a subclass provides a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass.

```java
class MyClass {
    // Method Overloading
    void display(int x) {
        System.out.println("Number: " + x);
    }

    void display(String str) {
        System.out.println("String: " + str);
    }
}

class SubClass extends MyClass {
    // Method Overriding
    @Override
    void display(String str) {
        System.out.println("Overridden String: " + str);
    }
}
```

## Exception and Exception Handling

An exception is an event that disrupts the normal flow of program execution. Exception handling allows you to gracefully handle such situations.

### Introduction to Exception Handling

In Java, exceptions are objects that are instances of classes derived from the `Throwable` class. Exception handling is done using `try`, `catch`, `finally`, and `throw` keywords.

```java
try {
    // Code that may throw an exception
} catch (ExceptionType e) {
    // Code to handle the exception
} finally {
    // Code that always executes, regardless of whether an exception occurred
}
```

### Null Pointer Exception and Stack Trace

A `NullPointerException` occurs when you try to access or call methods on an object reference that is `null`.

```java
String str = null;
System.out.println(str.length()); // Throws NullPointerException
```

The stack trace is a list of method calls that shows the sequence of calls leading to the point where the exception occurred.

### Checked versus Unchecked Exception

Checked exceptions are checked at compile-time, while unchecked exceptions are not.

```java
// Checked Exception
try {
    FileReader file = new FileReader("file.txt");
} catch (FileNotFoundException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}

// Unchecked Exception
int result = 10 / 0; // Throws ArithmeticException at runtime
```

### Drawing a Custom Exception

You can create custom exceptions by extending the `Exception` class or one of its subclasses.

```java
class CustomException extends Exception {
    public CustomException(String message) {
        super(message);
    }
}
```

## Introduction to Serialization

Serialization is the process of converting an object into a byte stream so that it can be easily stored, transmitted, or reconstructed later.

### Writing Serialized Object

To write an object to a file in serialized form, you use `ObjectOutputStream`.

```java
try {
    FileOutputStream fileOut = new FileOutputStream("object.ser");
    ObjectOutputStream out = new ObjectOutputStream(fileOut);
    out.writeObject(obj);
    out.close();
    fileOut.close();
} catch (IOException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}
```

### What Happens to an Object When It's Serialized

When an object is serialized, its state is saved as a sequence of bytes, including the object's data and information about its class.

### Basic Principle of Serialization

Serialization is achieved by implementing the `Serializable` interface, which is a marker interface with no methods.

```java
public class MyClass implements Serializable {
    // Class definition
}
```

### Transient Variable

A `transient` variable is a variable that should not be serialized. When an object is serialized, transient variables are not included in the serialization process.

```java
public class MyClass implements Serializable {
    transient int sensitiveData; // This variable won't be serialized
}
```

## Input Stream and Output Stream Deserialization

Deserialization is the process of converting a byte stream back into an object.

### Designing Principle of Deserialization

To deserialize an object, you use `ObjectInputStream`.

```java
try {
    FileInputStream fileIn = new FileInputStream("object.ser");
    ObjectInputStream in = new ObjectInputStream(fileIn);
    MyClass obj = (MyClass) in.readObject();
    in.close();
    fileIn.close();
} catch (IOException | ClassNotFoundException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}
```

### Creating Connection Stream for Deserialization

Connection streams, such as `FileInputStream`, `ObjectInputStream`, etc., are used to establish a connection between the Java program and the source or destination of data during deserialization.

```java
FileInputStream fileIn = new FileInputStream("object.ser");
ObjectInputStream in = new ObjectInputStream(fileIn);
```

# Introduction to Exception Handling

In Java, an exception is an event that disrupts the normal flow of program execution. Exception handling allows you to gracefully manage and recover from these unexpected events.

## Null Pointer Exception and Stack Trace

A `NullPointerException` occurs when you try to access or call methods on an object reference that is `null`.

```java
String str = null;
System.out.println(str.length()); // Throws NullPointerException
```

The stack trace is a list of method calls that shows the sequence of calls leading to the point where the exception occurred.

## Checked versus Unchecked Exception

Checked exceptions are checked at compile-time, while unchecked exceptions are not.

```java
// Checked Exception
try {
    FileReader file = new FileReader("file.txt");
} catch (FileNotFoundException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}

// Unchecked Exception
int result = 10 / 0; // Throws ArithmeticException at runtime
```

## Drawing a Custom Exception

You can create custom exceptions by extending the `Exception` class or one of its subclasses.

```java
class CustomException extends Exception {
    public CustomException(String message) {
        super(message);
    }
}
```

# Executing Tasks in Parallel with Fork-Join Pool

The Fork-Join framework in Java provides support for executing tasks concurrently using multiple processors.

## Recursive Action and Recursive Task

- **RecursiveAction**: Represents a task that doesn't return any value but may have side effects.
- **RecursiveTask**: Represents a task that returns a result.

```java
class MyRecursiveAction extends RecursiveAction {
    // Implement compute() method
}

class MyRecursiveTask extends RecursiveTask<Integer> {
    // Implement compute() method
}
```

## Exception Handling and Cancelling a Task

You can handle exceptions thrown during task execution and cancel tasks if necessary.

```java
try {
    forkJoinPool.invoke(task);
} catch (Exception e) {
    // Handle exception
}
task.cancel(true); // Cancel the task
```

## Callable and Future

`Callable` represents a task that can be executed asynchronously and returns a result, while `Future` represents the result of an asynchronous computation.

```java
ExecutorService executor = Executors.newCachedThreadPool();
Callable<Integer> task = () -> {
    // Perform some computation
    return result;
};
Future<Integer> future = executor.submit(task);
Integer result = future.get(); // Retrieve the result
```

# Thread and Thread Pool

Threads in Java are lightweight processes that execute tasks concurrently.

## Thread Life Cycle

The life cycle of a thread includes several states: new, runnable, blocked, waiting, timed waiting, and terminated.

```java
Thread thread = new Thread(() -> {
    // Thread logic
});
thread.start(); // Start the thread
```

## Thread Pool

A thread pool is a collection of pre-initialized threads that can be used to execute tasks concurrently, improving performance by reusing threads.

```java
ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(5); // Create a thread pool with 5 threads
executor.execute(() -> {
    // Task logic
});
executor.shutdown(); // Shutdown the executor when no longer needed
```

# Sequential Streams and Parallel Streams

Java Streams provide a way to process collections of objects in a functional-style manner.

## Sequential Streams

Sequential streams process elements in a single-threaded manner, one after the other.

```java
List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
int sum = numbers.stream()
                 .filter(n -> n % 2 == 0)
                 .mapToInt(n -> n)
                 .sum();
```

## Parallel Streams

Parallel streams enable concurrent processing of elements, leveraging multiple threads for improved performance.

```java
int sum = numbers.parallelStream()
                 .filter(n -> n % 2 == 0)
                 .mapToInt(n -> n)
                 .sum();
```

# Publishers, Subscribers, and Subscriptions

In Java, the Reactive Streams API provides support for asynchronous stream processing with non-blocking backpressure.

## Publisher

A publisher is a source of data that emits items to subscribers.

## Subscriber

A subscriber consumes items emitted by a publisher.

## Subscription

A subscription represents the relationship between a publisher and a subscriber, allowing the subscriber to request items and manage backpressure.

# Thread Life Cycle, Structured Locks, and Working with Locks

In Java, threads have a defined life cycle with various states, and locks are used to control access to shared resources.

## Thread Life Cycle

The life cycle of a thread includes states such as new, runnable, blocked, waiting, timed waiting, and terminated.

## Structured Locks

Java provides structured locks, such as `ReentrantLock` and `ReadWriteLock`, for controlling access to shared resources in a multithreaded environment.

```java
Lock lock = new ReentrantLock();
lock.lock(); // Acquire the lock
try {
    // Critical section
} finally {
    lock.unlock(); // Release the lock
}
```

## Wait, Notify, and New OnSpinWait

The `wait()` and `notify()` methods are used for inter-thread communication, while `onSpinWait()` provides hints to the runtime about spinning behavior.

```java
synchronized (monitor) {
    while (!condition) {
        monitor.wait(); // Release the lock and wait
    }
    // Perform task
    monitor.notify(); // Notify waiting threads
}
```

# Atomic Types and Compare-and-Set Approach

In Java, atomic types provide thread-safe operations without needing explicit synchronization.

## Atomic Types

Atomic types, such as `AtomicInteger` and `AtomicBoolean`, provide atomic operations for variables.

```java
AtomicInteger count = new AtomicInteger(0);
count.incrementAndGet(); // Atomically increment the value
```

## Compare-and-Set Approach

The compare-and-set approach is used to update a variable's value atomically if its current value matches an expected value.

```java
AtomicInteger count = new AtomicInteger(0);
int expected = 0;
int update = 1;
boolean success = count.compareAndSet(expected, update);
```

# Concurrent Collections

Java provides concurrent collections, which are thread-safe alternatives to traditional collections for use in multithreaded environments.

## ConcurrentHashMap

`ConcurrentHashMap` is a thread-safe implementation of the `Map` interface, allowing concurrent access from multiple threads without external synchronization.

```java
ConcurrentMap<String, Integer> map = new ConcurrentHashMap<>();
map.put("key", 1); // Thread-safe operation
```

## ConcurrentLinkedQueue

`ConcurrentLinkedQueue` is a thread-safe implementation of the `Queue` interface, suitable for concurrent access from multiple threads.

```java
Queue<Integer> queue = new ConcurrentLinkedQueue<>();
queue.offer(1); // Thread-safe operation
```

# Blocking Queues and Copy-on-Write Collections

Blocking queues provide additional functionality for concurrent programming, while copy-on-write collections offer thread-safe iteration.

## Blocking Queues

Blocking queues support operations that wait for the queue to become non-empty or non-full before proceeding.

```java
BlockingQueue<Integer> queue = new ArrayBlockingQueue<>(10);
queue.put(1); // Waits if the queue is full
int value = queue.take(); // Waits if the queue is empty
```

## Copy-on-Write Collections

Copy-on-write collections create a new copy of the collection whenever it's modified, ensuring thread safety during iteration.

```java
Copy

OnWriteArrayList<Integer> list = new CopyOnWriteArrayList<>();
list.add(1); // Thread-safe operation
Iterator<Integer> iterator = list.iterator(); // Thread-safe iteration
```

# What is XML?

XML (eXtensible Markup Language) is a markup language that defines rules for encoding documents in a format that is both human-readable and machine-readable. It's widely used for storing and transporting data, especially on the internet.

## Application of XML

XML is commonly used for:

- Storing and transporting structured data
- Configuration files
- Web services (SOAP and RESTful APIs)
- Data interchange between different systems
- Representing hierarchical data structures

## XML Format and Structure

XML documents consist of elements, attributes, and text content, organized in a hierarchical structure.

### XML Elements

Elements are the building blocks of an XML document and are enclosed within start and end tags.

```xml
<book>
    <title>Java Programming</title>
    <author>John Doe</author>
</book>
```

### XML Attributes

Attributes provide additional information about an element and are specified within the start tag.

```xml
<book category="fiction">
    <title>Java Programming</title>
    <author>John Doe</author>
</book>
```

### XML Tags

Tags are the combination of start and end tags that enclose elements and their content.

```xml
<book>
    <title>Java Programming</title>
    <author>John Doe</author>
</book>
```

### XML Syntax

XML syntax follows strict rules, including well-formedness and validity.

- **Well-Formed XML**: Follows basic syntax rules, such as having a single root element and properly nested tags.
- **Valid XML**: Follows a predefined structure defined by a Document Type Definition (DTD) or XML Schema.

```xml
<bookstore>
    <book>
        <title>Java Programming</title>
        <author>John Doe</author>
    </book>
</bookstore>
```

### XML Naming Rules and Practices

XML element and attribute names must adhere to specific naming rules:

- Names must start with a letter or underscore.
- Names can contain letters, digits, hyphens, underscores, and periods.
- Names cannot contain spaces or special characters.

```xml
<first_name>John</first_name>
<last_name>Doe</last_name>
```

# What is JSON?

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write and easy for machines to parse and generate. It's widely used for transmitting data between a server and a web application as an alternative to XML.

## JSON Data Types

JSON supports the following data types:

- **String**: A sequence of characters enclosed in double quotes.
- **Number**: A numeric value, which can be integer or floating-point.
- **Boolean**: Either `true` or `false`.
- **Array**: An ordered collection of values enclosed in square brackets.
- **Object**: An unordered collection of key-value pairs enclosed in curly braces.
- **Null**: Represents a null value.

```json
{
    "name": "John",
    "age": 30,
    "isStudent": false,
    "grades": [85, 90, 75],
    "address": {
        "street": "123 Main St",
        "city": "New York"
    },
    "isActive": null
}
```

JSON is commonly used in web development for transmitting data between a server and a web application, such as in AJAX requests and RESTful APIs.

### Java Collections Framework

Java Collections Framework is a set of classes and interfaces in Java that provide reusable, high-performance data structures and algorithms. It includes implementations for storing, manipulating, and accessing groups of objects. Here's an overview:

---

### Core Interfaces

These interfaces define the basic behaviors of collections:

#### 1. **List**

A dynamic array that allows duplicate elements and maintains insertion order.

| Method       | Description                                        |
|--------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| `add(E e)`   | Appends the specified element to the end of this list. |
| `get(int index)` | Returns the element at the specified position in this list. |
| `remove(int index)` | Removes the element at the specified position in this list. |

#### 2. **Set**

A collection that does not allow duplicate elements.

| Method       | Description                                        |
|--------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| `add(E e)`   | Adds the specified element to this set if it is not already present. |
| `contains(Object o)` | Returns true if this set contains the specified element. |
| `remove(Object o)` | Removes the specified element from this set if it is present. |

#### 3. **Map**

An object that maps keys to values. A key is an object that you use to retrieve a value at a later date.

| Method       | Description                                        |
|--------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| `put(K key, V value)` | Associates the specified value with the specified key in this map. |
| `get(Object key)` | Returns the value to which the specified key is mapped, or null if this map contains no mapping for the key. |
| `remove(Object key)` | Removes the mapping for the specified key from this map if present. |

---

### Core Implementations

Java provides several implementations of these interfaces:

#### 1. **ArrayList**

Resizable-array implementation of the List interface.

```java
List<String> list = new ArrayList<>();
list.add("Hello");
list.add("World");
```

#### 2. **HashSet**

Implements Set interface, backed by a hash table (actually a HashMap instance).

```java
Set<String> set = new HashSet<>();
set.add("Apple");
set.add("Banana");
```

#### 3. **HashMap**

Implements Map interface, stores key-value pairs.

```java
Map<String, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
map.put("one", 1);
map.put("two", 2);
```

---

### Utility Classes

Java Collections Framework includes utility classes for manipulating collections:

#### 1. **Collections**

Provides static methods for sorting, searching, reversing, and synchronizing collections.

```java
List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(3, 1, 2);
Collections.sort(numbers);
```

#### 2. **Arrays**

Contains various methods for manipulating arrays (which are not technically part of the Collections Framework, but often used in conjunction with collections).

```java
int[] arr = {3, 1, 2};
Arrays.sort(arr);
```

---

### Specialized Collections

Java provides specialized collections to meet specific needs:

#### 1. **LinkedList**

Doubly-linked list implementation of the List and Deque interfaces.

```java
LinkedList<String> linkedList = new LinkedList<>();
linkedList.add("First");
linkedList.add("Second");
```

#### 2. **TreeSet**

Implements the Set interface using a tree.

```java
Set<String> treeSet = new TreeSet<>();
treeSet.add("C");
treeSet.add("A");
treeSet.add("B");
```

#### 3. **TreeMap**

Implements the Map interface using a Red-Black tree.

```java
Map<String, Integer> treeMap = new TreeMap<>();
treeMap.put("one", 1);
treeMap.put("two", 2);
```

---

### Methods and Operations

Java Collections Framework provides various methods and operations to work with collections efficiently:

#### 1. **Iteration**

Looping through elements in a collection using iterators or enhanced for loop.

```java
List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3);
for (Integer num : numbers) {
    System.out.println(num);
}
```

#### 2. **Filtering**

Filtering elements based on certain criteria using streams.

```java
List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
List<Integer> evenNumbers = numbers.stream()
                                    .filter(n -> n % 2 == 0)
                                    .collect(Collectors.toList());
```

#### 3. **Sorting**

Sorting elements using `Collections.sort()` method or stream API.

```java
List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(3, 1, 2);
Collections.sort(numbers);
```

#### 4. **Searching**

Searching for elements in a collection using methods like `contains()` or `indexOf()`.

```java
List<String> names = Arrays.asList("Alice", "Bob", "Charlie");
if (names.contains("Bob")) {
    System.out.println("Bob is in the list.");
}
```
