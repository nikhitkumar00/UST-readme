# Data Types

In Java, data types specify the type of data that a variable can hold. They determine the size and format of the data that can be stored in memory. Java supports various data types, which can be classified into different categories. Let's explore integral data types and type casting in Java:

## Integral Data Types

Integral data types in Java are used to represent whole numbers (integers) without any fractional or decimal parts. They can be further classified into four categories based on their size and signedness:

### 1. `byte`

-   Size: 8 bits
-   Range: -128 to 127 (inclusive)
-   Default value: 0

### 2. `short`

-   Size: 16 bits
-   Range: -32,768 to 32,767 (inclusive)
-   Default value: 0

### 3. `int`

-   Size: 32 bits
-   Range: -2^31 to 2^31 - 1 (approximately -2.1 billion to 2.1 billion)
-   Default value: 0

### 4. `long`

-   Size: 64 bits
-   Range: -2^63 to 2^63 - 1 (approximately -9.2 quintillion to 9.2 quintillion)
-   Default value: 0L

```java
byte myByte = 10;
short myShort = 1000;
int myInt = 1000000;
long myLong = 1000000000L;
```

## Type Casting

Type casting in Java is the process of converting a value from one data type to another. It can be classified into two types: implicit casting (widening) and explicit casting (narrowing).

### Implicit Casting (Widening)

Implicit casting occurs when you assign a value of a smaller data type to a variable of a larger data type. Java automatically performs the conversion without requiring any explicit syntax.

```java
int myInt = 100;
long myLong = myInt; // Implicit casting from int to long
```

### Explicit Casting (Narrowing)

Explicit casting occurs when you assign a value of a larger data type to a variable of a smaller data type. It requires the use of parentheses and the target data type to indicate that data loss may occur.

```java
double myDouble = 3.14;
int myInt = (int) myDouble; // Explicit casting from double to int
```

It's important to note that explicit casting may result in data loss or overflow if the value being casted cannot be represented accurately in the target data type.

Understanding data types and type casting is essential for writing Java programs that manipulate and process different types of data. By utilizing the appropriate data types and casting techniques, you can ensure that your Java code behaves as expected and handles data effectively.
